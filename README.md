## DRM protected streams

Some content is DRM protected and requires the proprietary decryption module 
Widevine CDM for playback. You will be prompted to install this if you're attempting to
play a stream without the binary installed.

Most Android devices have built-in support for Widevine DRM and doesn't require 
any additional binaries. You can see if your Android device supports Widevine DRM by 
using the DRM Info app available in Play Store.
